# Deployment Safety Guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Your Data is Safe

This document explains what happens during deployment and confirms that **your database and user data will NOT be destroyed**.

## Protected Files & Data

The following are **NEVER touched** by deployments:

### 1. Database Files
- **Location:** `/var/www/echohub/{env}/database/*.sqlite`
- **Protection:** Listed in `.gitignore`, never committed to git
- **Result:** Database persists across all deployments
- **Your data:** Users, apps, contacts, messages - all preserved

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **Location:** `/var/www/echohub/{env}/.env`
- **Protection:** Listed in `.gitignore`, never committed to git
- **Result:** Configuration (API keys, secrets, database path) persists
- **Your settings:** All environment variables preserved

### 3. User Uploads & Storage
- **Location:** `/var/www/echohub/{env}/storage/`
- **Protection:** Only code files are updated by git, storage content remains
- **Result:** Uploaded files, logs, sessions all preserved
- **Your files:** All user-uploaded content safe

## What Gets Updated

On each deployment, **only these are updated**:

### 1. Application Code
```bash
git reset --hard origin/{branch}
```
- Updates PHP files, JavaScript, views
- Does NOT touch .env or database files

### 2. Dependencies
```bash
composer install
bun install
```
- Updates PHP packages and Node modules
- Does NOT affect your data

### 3. Frontend Assets
```bash
bun run build
```
- Rebuilds CSS/JS bundles
- Does NOT touch backend data

### 4. Database Schema (Safe Migrations)
```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```
- **ONLY adds new tables/columns** from new migrations
- **NEVER drops existing tables**
- **NEVER deletes data**
- Existing data remains untouched

## Dangerous Commands (NOT Used)

These commands would destroy data, but **are NOT in the deployment workflow**:

‚ùå `php artisan migrate:fresh` - Would drop all tables
‚ùå `php artisan migrate:rollback` - Would remove migrations
‚ùå `php artisan db:wipe` - Would destroy database
‚ùå `rm database/*.sqlite` - Would delete database files

**None of these are used in automated deployments!**

## Deployment Workflow Safety Checklist

Every deployment runs this exact sequence:

1. ‚úÖ Fix file ownership (code files only)
2. ‚úÖ Pull latest code via git (respects .gitignore)
3. ‚úÖ Install PHP dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Install Node dependencies
5. ‚úÖ Build frontend assets
6. ‚úÖ **Run safe migrations** (adds only, never deletes)
7. ‚úÖ Clear caches (config, routes, views)
8. ‚úÖ Set file permissions
9. ‚úÖ Restart services

**At no point is the database deleted, dropped, or recreated.**

## Verification

You can verify the safety yourself:

### Check .gitignore
```bash
# Database files are ignored
cat database/.gitignore
# Output: *.sqlite*

# .env is ignored
grep "\.env" .gitignore
# Output: .env
```

### Check Deployment Script
```bash
# View the exact deployment commands
cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# Confirm: only "migrate --force" is used (safe)
# Confirm: no "migrate:fresh" or "db:wipe" commands
```

### Check Database Persistence
```bash
# On server, check database file timestamps
ssh user@server "ls -la /var/www/echohub/production/database/*.sqlite"
# File date never changes on deployment (only modified when data changes)
```

## Manual Database Operations

If you ever need to reset the database manually (testing, etc), these commands are **ONLY run when you explicitly execute them**:

```bash
# These require manual execution and confirmation
php artisan migrate:fresh        # Drops all tables (asks for confirmation in production)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed # Drops and reseeds (asks for confirmation in production)
```

Laravel's production mode requires explicit "Yes" confirmation for destructive operations.

## Backup Recommendations

Even though deployments are safe, you should still backup your database periodically:

```bash
# Create a backup script
./deployment/backup-database.sh production

# This creates:
# /var/backups/echohub/production-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.sqlite
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Database files:** Protected by .gitignore, never destroyed
‚úÖ **.env configuration:** Protected by .gitignore, never overwritten
‚úÖ **User uploads:** Preserved in storage/ directory
‚úÖ **Migration safety:** Only adds new tables, never deletes data
‚úÖ **Production safeguards:** Laravel asks for confirmation before destructive operations

**Your data is safe. Deploy with confidence!**
